no name yet ... this is just the most minimal shell to toggle fullscreen from a chrome packaged app.

it's just a simple empty window ...

... but the button will toggle you in and out of full screen. which is where you want to be.

USAGE: (Chrome)
* Download this code into a local folder (either zip or git clone)
* Enter chrome://extensions into the URL bar
* Click the "Load Unpacked Extension" button and select the local folder
* Click the "Launch" link for this new extension

(look it's the base of a polyhedron:)

__FYI:__ the original "most minimal packaged app full-screen toggle demo" will wind up in the ["first-base"](https://github.com/figital/first-base) repo ... the other <webview> experiments would be here in "base". first-base will probably be an exact duplicate of Tag 1.0: https://github.com/figital/base/tree/v1.0
